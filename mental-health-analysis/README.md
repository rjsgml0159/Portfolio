# EEG Signal Analysis – Seizure vs Non-Seizure Patterns

## Overview
This project investigates differences between epileptic seizure and non-seizure EEG segments using interpretable signal-based features.

## Objectives
- Work with labeled EEG segments
- Extract time-domain and frequency-domain features
- Compare signal characteristics between conditions

## Methods
EEG segments were analyzed using feature-based approaches, including measures of signal variability and spectral properties.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy / SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaway
This analysis highlights experience with structured datasets, feature extraction, visualization, and research-oriented data interpretation.
