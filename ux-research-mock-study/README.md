# UX Research Mock Study – Campus Study App Concept

## Overview
This mock UX research project explores how students experience study-related stress and how a digital tool might better support planning, focus, and workload management.

## Research Goal
The goal of this study was to understand common frustrations in students’ study routines and identify opportunities for improving usability and cognitive load in a hypothetical campus study app.

## Method
- Designed a brief survey simulating student feedback
- Focused on study habits, workload perception, and stress factors
- Synthesized responses into qualitative themes

## Key Insights
- Students struggle more with task organization than time availability
- Perceived workload is strongly tied to stress levels
- Simple interfaces are preferred over feature-heavy designs

## Design Implications
Findings suggest that clarity, minimalism, and reduced decision friction are critical for productivity-oriented student tools.

## Note
This project is a self-initiated mock study created for learning and portfolio purposes.
